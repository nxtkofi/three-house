# Three js react project
I decided to learn Three js with react. Main motivation being cool stuff that people make with it. I decided to try out react-fiber-threejs and also amazin library called drei.

### What I'm going to create?

##### Backstory(skip if You're not interested)
I have a script that randomly selects my wallpapers whenever I do Command+Shift+W. I use it, because I have over 4GB's of wallpapers on my desktop and it feels quite refreshing to see something new, especially with pywal!
On the day that I started learning three js I've randomly used this command and received the following wallpaper:
![Wallpaper](/home/piotrek/assets/README-img/2024-12-23-at-22-19-30.avif)
I didn't really look at it (I usually don't pay much attention to this), but then I realized that this wallpaper can be recreated in three.js and it shouldn't cause much of a trouble since it's just moving boxes around.

Thus why I decided to recreate the above wallpaper as my first three project!
